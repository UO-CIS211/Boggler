# Boggler
Boggle solver - sample code for UO CIS 211 text supplements (https://uo-cis211.github.io/)

This will be sample code to illustrate a chapter on recursive search.  

The main project associated with this chapter is a Sudoku solver.   
Boggle is a simpler puzzle in which the potential moves are simply to 
continue left, right, up, or down.  Nevertheless it has the essential
element of saving and restoring board states during a recursive search.
